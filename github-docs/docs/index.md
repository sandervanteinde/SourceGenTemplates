# {{packagename}}

{{packagename}} is, as the name suggests, a template driven way of writing source generators.

Normal source generators can be created by creating an Analyzer package by yourself. With {{packagename}} the process of
writing your own source generators is greatly simplified.

Using a set of predefined C#-like directives you are able to create the most advanced source generators.

Being able to extend your own code base has never been easier!
