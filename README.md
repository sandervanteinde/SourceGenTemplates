# C# Source Generators

C# Source Generators is, as the name suggests, a template driven way of writing source generators.

Normal source generators can be created by creating an Analyzer package by yourself. With {{packagename}} the process of
writing your own source generators is greatly simplified.

Using a set of predefined C#-like directives you are able to create the most advanced source generators.

Being able to extend your own code base has never been easier!

## Installation

Simply add it to your C# project using `dotnet package add SourceGenTemplates`.

## First template
For writing your first template, please visit our documentation website for more information on how to start and detailed explanation of the templating language:
