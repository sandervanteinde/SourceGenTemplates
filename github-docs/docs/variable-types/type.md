# Type variable
The type variable represents a reference to a Type in C#.

## String representation
The string representation of a Type is its fully qualified name. This is done so that, no matter where you push this variable, you never get clashes with namespaces or using statements.

Therefore, showing a `Type` variable can be done everywhere without having to add `using`'s to your code.
