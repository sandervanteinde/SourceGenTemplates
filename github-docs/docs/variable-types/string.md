# String variable
The string variable represents a string of characters

## String representation
You might not expect this, but the string representation of a string is the string it's representing.

## Available properties
There are no properties available, although I do encourage you to take a look at [mutators](../language/mutators.md) to see how you can mutate variables.

Most mutators are intended to work with strings.
